-- V41: Append-only audit log for tracking all state-changing operations
-- Financial applications need an immutable audit trail. Every state-changing
-- operation (job status change, escrow release, dispute filing, etc.) should
-- be logged with before/after snapshots so that any change can be traced.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_log (
  id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  old_value       JSONB,
  new_value       JSONB,
  created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
